                                                            and instead conserved it for emergencies (we never know; wasn’t exactly hoping tho).</div>

                                                            which disrupted the internet connection. Later that night, the electricity also went down due to the bad weather.

                                                            either electricity or internet or both of them. When the power went out, it was and even more additional inconvenience. At first, I was frustrated. 
                                                            I kept thinking about all the to-dos piling up and how behind I'd be (probably my fault though, 
                                                            for my poor time management). But after a while, I realized getting worked up wouldn't magically bring the power back or fix the internet. 
                                                            So it was patience and acceptance together that I practiced to cope with this situation.</div>

                                                            When I finally got transportation and arrived at practice, I resisted complaining even as the sweltering heat made every movement feel exhausting. 
                                                            The intense heat made everything feel twice as hard and I could feel everything slowly getting on my nerves. However, I chose to stay focused, push through the discomfort, 
                                                            and complete our dance practice without letting frustration take over.</div>

                                                             During practice, the weather was especially hot like I'm not even exaggerating (but probably because we were dancing too). Even before we started practicing, 
                                                             my shirt and towel were already soaked with sweat and I already finished the bottled water I bought supposedly for 'water break'.</div>

                                <div class="section-content">Honestly, it was rough. Standing there waiting for over an hour, each passing minute made me more anxious about being late, 
                                                            really really tested my patience. By the time I finally got to practice, I was already exhausted before we even started dancing. 
                                                            The worst part was when the sun felt like it was burning right through us, and every move made me sweat even more.
                                                            The heat made it easy to lose focus, and my tired body begged for a break.
                                                            What really challenged me was keeping my cool when all I wanted to do was complain or just stop. 
                                                            Beyond just enduring the endless waiting, I also practiced patience by pushing through the unbearable heat without (prolly minimal) complaining.</div>

                                                            Still, I chose to stay calm, not complain, and wait because I knew getting angry wouldn’t help. It wasn’t easy,

Our group agreed to meet at 8 AM so we could practice before the event started at 10. However, I faced delays on the way due to slow jeepney rides (yeah for the nth time), and when I arrived, some of my classmates weren’t there yet. That caused more waiting. During the event, our performance was scheduled later because Ma’am Julie had many handled sections from different porgrams. After the event, my trip home was long and uncomfortable due to the intense heat, which made the day even more tiring and tested my patience further.</div>

                    <div class="reflection-question">1. What was easy or difficult about practicing your chosen virtue?</div>
                    <div class="reflection-answer">
                        <strong>What was really hard:</strong><br>
                        Honestly, practicing patience was super tough this whole week. The hardest part was when everything seemed to go wrong at the same time like when I'm already dealing with coding errors that won't fix, and then the weather is crazy hot, and on top of that I have to wait forever for transportation or my classmates to show up. The heat made everything worse because it made me grumpy even before other problems started. I think I might have some anger issues, or maybe it's just because of how hot it was, but I found myself getting really frustrated easily.<br>
                        The coding part was especially annoying because every time I thought I fixed something, another error would pop up. It felt like a never-ending cycle. And don't get me started on waiting for classmates, showing up on time just to wait for hours while everyone else is late really tested me. Sometimes I just wanted to complain or give up completely.<br>

                        <br><strong>What helped make it easier:</strong><br>
                        Taking breaks when I felt my anger building up really helped. I learned that when I started getting mad, stepping away for a bit was better than forcing myself to keep going.
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="reflection-question">2. Did you notice any changes in your behavior, mindset, or how others reacted to you?</div>
                    <div class="reflection-answer">
                       <strong>How I started acting differently:</strong><br>
                        I definitely became more aware of how I react to annoying situations. Before this week, I probably would have just complained right away or gotten visibly frustrated. But I started catching myself and choosing to take deep breaths instead. I also found myself trying to encourage my groupmates when they got stuck with coding problems, instead of adding to the stress by being grumpy too.
                        I got better at arriving early and just accepting that waiting is part of life, especially with my classmates who are always late. I stopped expecting them to be on time and just naturally wait for them.<br>

                        <br><strong>How my thinking changed:</strong><br>
                        The biggest change was realizing that staying patient actually made me better at solving problems. When I was calm, I could think more clearly about coding issues and figure out solutions faster than when I was stressed out and rushing. I started seeing problems like bugs and delays as just normal parts of life instead of personal attacks on my day.<br>
                        I also accepted that some things are just out of my control, like the weather, power outages, internet problems, and other people being late. Getting worked up about these things doesn't change anything, so why waste my energy being mad?<br>

                        <br><strong>How people reacted to me:</strong><br>
                        Even though I didn't write about it much in my daily entries, I think my groupmates appreciated that I stayed calm during our coding sessions. When I wasn't getting frustrated and complaining, it seemed like everyone could focus better and we worked together more smoothly. The atmosphere felt less tense when I kept my cool. My classmates probably noticed that I didn't complain as much about waiting, even when they were really late. I think they felt less guilty because I wasn't making them feel bad about it.<br>
                                            </div>

                        <strong>What I learned overall:</strong><br>
                        By the end of the week, being patient felt a little more natural, though I still had to really try hard sometimes. The most important thing I realized is that patience isn't just about suffering through bad situations quietly, it's about staying calm so you can think better and handle things more effectively. It also makes life more peaceful for everyone around you.
                        I'm still not perfect at it, and I probably still have moments where I almost break down, but at least now I know that patience actually works and makes things better, not worse.
